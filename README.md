# snpit

Whole genome SNP based identification of members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Based on code originally written by Samuel Lipworth and turned into a package by Philip Fowler.

SNP-IT allows rapid Mycobacterial speciation of VCF files aligned to NC000962 (H37rV).

For more information please see this preprint;

## How to install

First clone the repository on your local machine

```   
> git clone https://github.com/philipwfowler/snpit.git
Cloning into 'snpit'...
remote: Counting objects: 140, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 140 (delta 7), reused 13 (delta 6), pack-reused 122
Receiving objects: 100% (140/140), 2.95 MiB | 3.58 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (58/58), done.
```   
then enter the directory and install
```
> cd snpit
> python setup install --user
```
The `--user` flag ensures that it is only installed for the user (avoiding the need to know the root/sudo password). To system-wide install simply omit the flag.

## Dependencies

The code requires the BioPython, Gzip and PyVCF Python packages. The above installation process will detect if they already installed in the local machine, and if not, download and install them.

## Usage

The code is Python3 and a `snpit` class is defined. To demonstrate simple usage, a python script that calls the package (`snpit-run.py`) which can be found in `bin/` folder is installed in your `$PATH` during installation. To see what it does, a single example VCF is provided in the `example/` folder

```
> cd example
> ls
example.vcf
```

To run simply
```
> snpit-run.py --input example.vcf 
example.vcf
     M. tuberculosis        Lineage 2                  97.7 %
```
Note that, as shown in the paper, sublineages are only available for Lineage 4, hence no sublineage is reported for this sample. To alter how the results are output, please see the `bin/snpit-run.py` script.
